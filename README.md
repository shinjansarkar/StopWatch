# StopWatch
I created a stopwatch using prompting with the help of AI tools, significantly speeding up the development process. The stopwatch features three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset, making it user-friendly and functional. Additionally, I enhanced its visual appeal by incorporating a nice background picture. Leveraging AI tools streamlined the design and implementation phases, allowing me to focus on optimizing the user interface and overall aesthetics. The result is an efficient and visually pleasing stopwatch application, completed in a fraction of the time it would have taken using traditional methods.
